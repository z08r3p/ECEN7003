Project-1 
MOSFET Characteristic Analysis and Single-stage Amplifier Design 
Part-I MOSFET Characteristic Analysis and Simulation 
Part-I Objectives:
1. Basic I-V characteristic: 
(1) Based on the simulated results, analyze the ID-VDS, ID-VGS relations of 1.2-V NMOS;
(2) figure out the operation regions;
(3) estimate the corresponding gm  rout from their definitions.(Hint: by doing parametric analysis in Cadence)
2. Body effect and short-channel effect: 
Simulate, observe, and try to discuss the effect from VSB and channel length L on the Vth of 1.2-V NMOS.
3. Simulation vs hand-calculation of ID: 
Obtain the parameters of μnCox and λ (channel length modulation coefficient) for 1.2-V NMOS from simulation. Use them in the hand calculation of IDthen compare the calculated result with the simulated ones.
(Hint: the ‘betaeff’ parameter in DC analysis simulation result represent the ‘μnCoxW/L’)
Part-II Single-stage Amplifier Design and Simulation 
Part-II Objectives:
1. Schematic design and simulation: 
Use 1.2-V CMOS devices to design and simulate CS, CG, and SF amplifiers. (Body effect discussion is suggested)

2. Layout implementation (*optional bonus):
For the designed CS amplifier,代 写ECEN7003 Microelectronic Circuit Design Project-1Prolog

• The overall achieved performance would be the higher, the better, i.e., higher gain, larger GBW, lower power, and smaller area.
